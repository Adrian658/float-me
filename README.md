# float-me
### Some programs I have written in python dealing with floats (converting to binary, comparing with epsilon)
### Obviously these are using python so they won't be terribly efficient, but the aim for me here is just to gain a deeper understanding of how floats are handled by the compiler. Would like to rewrite this in C sometime.
